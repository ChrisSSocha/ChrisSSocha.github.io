### Graff's Temple

Graff would happily take over the “The Scythe and Sheaf Inn” in Verbobonc, sanctifying the once evil grounds, and converting the space into a temple to Rudd. Verbobonc is the perfect place for an adventurer's guild, north of the elven Kingdom of Celene, west of the Gnarly Forest and the Domain of Greyhawk, and east of the diocese of Veluna, and South of the Kingdom of Furyondy. The added mystique of the once hallowed grounds of Vecna is sure to attract some attention, anything to encourage those brave enough to serve Lady Luck.

The temple would essentially act as an Adventurer's Guild; The Inn would be kept intact (after all, all the best adventures start in an inn), and the basement would be converted into the temple itself. The basement is reserved for priests of Rudd, or adventurers who venture out in her name.

At first glance the main chamber of the temple looks very much like the Inn upstairs. There are a number of tables with stools, books and scrolls litter the far wall, tools befitting adventurers line the walls, and there is a small table in the corner set up with a set of playing cards and ivory dice. There are a few doors leading off from the central room; one leads off to a library (it’s not very full, but there is room to grow!), one leads to Graff’s private chambers, and a few other lead to some more basic sleeping quarters.

Graff’s plans are to continue exploring the Oerth, telling other of his adventures through his maps, with the ultimate goal of making the Temple of Rudd a font of cartographical knowledge. He will accept any well intentioned adventurer from all walks of life into the fold.

May her fortune favour the brave
