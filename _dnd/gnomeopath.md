### Backstory

Niilo was a son of a merchant selling potions and the like. He had a pretty uneventful childhood, living in the relative safety of his family home and being taught how to be a merchant from his father.

One night, while his father was away in a nearby town, he was awoken by an avatar of Baravar Cloakshadow, and warned that his father would come under attack from a group of marauding goblin on his way home. Nillo immediately for left to warn his father but by the time he arrived it was too late; his father had been torn apart by the goblins, and all his wares were stolen. The only thing remaining was his father's cart and their mule, who looked a bit shaken from the whole experience.

Niilo vowed to follow the path of The Sly One, mixing the god's tricksy ways with his mercantile upbringing, and defending all gnomes from the tyranny of goblinkin. This is where Niilo the Gnomeopath was born...

Niilo the Gnomeopath sells potions, oils, balms and the sort to those who will listen to him. Some of his wares are real, others are of a less effective variety. What you will be sold depends on your person:

* For those innocent and good of heart Niilo will charm (using his charismatic nature and magical illusions), and convince to buy some of his wares. In these cases he will often up sell his goods, perhaps describing a potion of fire breathing as a potion which will transform the user into a dragon, or a potion of water breathing as a potion will make them as powerful as blibdoolpoolp.
* For those who are not worthy he will continue to charm them, but convince them to buy some of his 'less effective wares', perhaps selling a potion of delusion instead of the real thing, even going as far as selling vials of colourful water to those with more money than sense.
* For those who oppose him, he will use his magic to defend himself and thoroughly spook his opponent. One of his darker tricks is to use Phantasmal Force to create the illusion of a murder of crows erupting from his tiny sleeves which encircle his opponent.

He uses his bright and colourful nature to put his name out there, and make sure he is the talk of the town (in one way or another). Niilo likes to think that he leaves most places as a local hero, but the reality is that there are times where he has had to make a quick escape as someone with a modicum of sense has seen through his trickery and illusion. This is also where his illusion takes center stage, as he use his web of deception and illusion to make a quick escape.

Some (fake) titles he uses:

* Fellow of the Guild of Pepperers
* Warden of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries
* Chief gnomeopath of the Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians
* Founder of the Order of the Gnomeopaths
* Chief stargazer of The Society of Astrologers
* Professor of the Academy of Predictive Astrology
* Horary Craftsman
* Master of the Chromotheraputic arts
* Treasurer of the Institute of Gem and Crystal Therapists
