## My Personal Blog

This is the source for personal blog. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create static pages, and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS.

Posts I want to do:

* Summary of 'The Art of Agile Development'
* Discussion of algorithms and complexity
* A look at Java 8
* Finish and public Responsive Character Sheet
