## My Personal Blog

This is the source for personal blog. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create static pages, and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS.

Since [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) does not allow for custom plugins, we must compile SASS to CSS before it is pushed to the repo - This is done by running `ruby SassConverter.rb`.
