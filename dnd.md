Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role playing game that I have been playing with friends and colleagues since August 2014. I've played in two 2nd edition campaigns, and have DM'd a few 5th edition one shots!

I've also created a [D&D 2e Spellbook](http://chris.socha.technology/spellbook/) web page to help people work out all the spells they should have access to.

I've also given lightning talks about why D&D is and why I enjoy playing it. (See: [slides]({{ 'assets/files/dnd-presentation.pdf' | absolute_url }}))

# Forgotten Realms (Aug 2014 - Jan 2018)

This campaign was set in the Forgotten Realms, in which I played two characters, Elyara Fei, an elven rogue from Evermeet, and Niilo Niiloson-Baublebreaker, a gnomish priest of Baravar Cloakshadow who rose through the ranks to become the Chosen of Baravar.

This campaign was set in Greyhawk, in which i played two characters, Elhadron, an elven Bladesinger, and Graff Millsbridge, a halfling cartographer priest of Rudd, the godess of luck and skill.

# DMing

I've had the chance to Dungeon Master two 5th edition games of my own making, _"The Peacekeepers of Erehwon"_, and _"The Restless Isles"_.
