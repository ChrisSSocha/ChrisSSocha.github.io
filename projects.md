# Smart Mirror

![Smart Mirror in Action]({{ "assets/img/smart-mirror.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right .small-img }

I designed and built a smart mirror that displays both my calendar for the day and the current TFL tube status. It turns on automatically in the morning when I wake up, and turns off shortly after I leave the house.

Hardware:

* RaspberryPi
* 12.1" TFT screen
* Ikea Picture frames
* 1-way mirror film
* [Sugru](https://sugru.com/)

Software:

* GitHub: [https://github.com/ChrisSSocha/Smart-Mirror](https://github.com/ChrisSSocha/Smart-Mirror)
