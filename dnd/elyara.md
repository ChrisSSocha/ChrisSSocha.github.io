###Personality

Having been brought up in Evermeet, Elyara has many of the beliefs and prejudices that come from the elven islands. She is friendly with most elven sub-races except the Drow (Although she thinks the Sun Elves are a bit 'uppity'). She has a distrust of most 'not-elves', and has heard many tales of human intolerance, repression, and murder. Despite these prejudices that were formed from upbringing, she is quite open minded to most things, and won't accept things just because she is told it is so.

### Background

Elyara lives in a small hunting community of wood elves on the outskirts of Leuthilspar, the capital city of the island kingdom of Evermeet. Elyara's parents are hunters, and have tried to teach her their trade. While Elyara had the beginnings of a fine hunter, she quickly realised that she preferred the thrill of the chase rather than the hunting itself.

After a time the thrill of hunting wasn't enough for Elyara, and she looked for new and exciting ways to have fun. She began sneaking into houses, and causing mischief by hiding things, moving things around, and breaking into strong boxes (but never stealing).

The mischief she causes is never intended to be 'bad' or cause harm; Indeed she is good willed, and will use her skills for good if needed, as long as she can have her fun after.

While Elyara's father is disappointed that she did not become a ranger like him, her mother is still proud the she had turned out to be a strong, energetic, and determined young woman. (Though both get angry when she gets caught breaking and entering)

She broadly follows the pantheon of Seldarine (as do many of her village) but favours Erevan Ilesere, the intermediate deity of trickery.

## Elyara’s adventures in Daggerford

Shortly after arriving at Daggerford, Elyara won favour with Kelson Darktreader, the Master of Hunt for the town, who quickly saw her natural talents when it came to hunting in the woods. In the early days she joined the hunt for fun, and it proved to be a good way to forget how far she was from home; Having seen what potential she has, Kelson soon asked if she would like to train as a Ranger with the Master of Hunt.

At first the training was going well, but Kelson noticed that Elyara often lost focus on the purpose of the hunt, and tried to show off by playing games with the animals. Elyara was starting to want more than just the thrill of the hunt, and fell back to her old ways of having fun at the expense of others in the town.

A few months into their stay at Daggerford during a late night ‘adventure’, while breaking into and rummaging round the hunting lodge, she was apprehended by Kelson. Kelson was disappointed and had lost patience with Elyara, casting her off from the hunting group but, despite his better judgement, did not hand her into the authorities.

Elyara’s training to become a Ranger had come to a halt, and for a number of weeks she did very little. One evening when in the local tavern she was approached by Filarion Filvenforson, a local adventurer of good repute, who was rumoured to have many shady skills. He had heard stories about Elyara’s evening adventures, and decided that she would make a much better thief than a ranger.

Of course he did not openly describe himself as a thief, but persuaded Elyara to train under his wing. He told her that there was little use in her training to hunt, as she was already quite nimble in the woods, and it was clearly not what she wanted to do. He convinced her that she could harness her energy and become a great rogue...

For the next year and half she spent many hours in the company of Filarion learning his trade, and practicing on the unsuspecting townsfolk of Daggerford.
