# Chris Socha

**Senior Software Engineer** at [Quin](https://quintech.io/). Weâ€™re using science, engineering and design to help people who take insulin make the best possible decisions!

Previously developer at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/) Electronic and Information Engineering graduate.

My interests in computing range from the small - *processor architecture, compilers, and embedded systems* - to the large - *enterprise software, and distributed systems*.
