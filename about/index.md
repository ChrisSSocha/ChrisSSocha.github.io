Hey, I'm Chris Socha.

I'm an **[Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/) Electronic and Information Engineering graduate**. My interests in computing range from the small - *processor architecture, compilers, and embedded systems* - to the large - *enterprise software, and distributed systems*.

I'm a **Software Engineer at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/)** (a software delivery and consulting company). As part of the grad scheme I was sent to India for 5 weeks of training (and a truly international experience), and am now working on delivery and consulting projects across Europe.
