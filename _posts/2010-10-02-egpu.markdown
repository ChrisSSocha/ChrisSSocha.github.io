title: X220 eGPU with Radeon HD 4870

I recently upgraded my old Dell Studio 1555 to a shiny new Lenovo ThinkPad X220.

Needless to say that i love my ThinkPad; it's light, powerful, and very well build. The X220's grapical capability however is somewhat lacking, leading me to look into the possibility of having an external graphics card.

The hardware i used was:

*   Lenovo ThinkPad X220
*   ATI Radeon HD 4870
*   Antec 350W PSU (VP350P)
*   PE4H (PCIe adapter 2.4)

An easy to use installation guide for connecting the PE4H to the X220 can be found on the [Notebook Review forums](http://forum.notebookreview.com/e-gpu-external-graphics-discussion/418851-diy-egpu-experiences-403.html#post7572285).

Having installed everything, I ran a few testbenches to compare the score of the internal GPU, and external GPU:

<center>
<table cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
        <th>Testbench</th>
        <th>X220 &amp; Intel HD 3000 Mobile</th>
        <th>X220 &amp; Radeon HD 4870</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3DMark 05</td>
        <td>3DMarks 6190</br>(CPU 17797)</td>
        <td>3DMarks 16593</br>(CPU 4233)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3DMark Vantage</td>
        <td>3DMarks P1804</br>(GFX 1421, CPU 9314)</td>
        <td>3DMarks P5543</br>(GFX 4852, CPU 9680)</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center>

We can see that the external GPU gives us ~3 times the 3DMarks for both '05 and Vantage. SUCCESS!

Clearly the scores for the HD 4850 are lower than if we were using a desktop PC with x16 PCIe (ExpressCard is ~ x1. The people of the internet suggest the performance loss due to this is roughly 50%).
