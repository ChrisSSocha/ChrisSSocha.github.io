I have designed and built a smart mirror that displays both my agenda for the day, and the current TFL tube status. It turns on automatically in the morning when I wake up, and turns off shortly after I leave the house.

**Hardware**

* RaspberryPi
* 12.1" TFT screen
* Ikea Picture frames
* 1-way mirror film
* [Sugru](https://sugru.com/)
